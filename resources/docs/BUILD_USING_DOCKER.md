# Focust - Build from Source using Docker and Docker Compose
This markdown document is used as a guide for anyone who wants to build Focust using [*Docker Compose*](https://github.com/docker/compose).

## Spring Application


### SSL Certificate
First, we need to a SSL certificate with `focust-spring` and `focust-spring.p12` being the *alias* and *keystore* respectively. You can do this by creating a **Self-Signed SSL Certificate**. If you want more information on how to create a Self-Signed SSL Certificate, I recommend the page ["How to Enable HTTPS in Spring Boot Application?"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-enable-https-in-spring-boot-application/) by *GeeksForGeeks*.

I recommend placing the generated `.p12` file into a hidden directory `.secrets` in the main project directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> changing the alias and keystore of the SSL Certificate should be reflected in the `./spring/src/main/resources/application.properties` file with the properties `server.ssl.key-store-alias` and `server.ssl.key-store`, respectively. Note that the `server.ssl.key-store` property needs to accept a value of `classpath:/keystore/[KEYSTORE]`, where `[KEYSTORE]` is the keystore value.

### Modifying `application.properties`
Next, we need to add the necessary sensitive information into the `./spring/src/main/resources/application.properties` file, as it is needed for the Spring Application to work properly. Once we open the file on an editor, you should see the following comment at the bottom of the file:

```application.properties
#====================================================#
#   Below will contain lines generated by Docker,    #
#   as it would include sensitive information that   #
#   should not be leaked in the GitHub repository.   #
#====================================================#
```

Below this is where you add the needed information, where the fields `[MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD]` (password for `root`), `[SPRING_SECURITY_PASSWORD]`, and `[SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD]` (password used to create the SSL Certificate)

```application.properties

### DATABASE ###
spring.datasource.username = root
spring.datasource.password = [MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD]

### SPRING SECURITY ###
spring.security.user.name = spring-admin
spring.security.user.password = [SPRING_SECURITY_PASSWORD]

### SSL ###
server.ssl.key-store-password=[SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD]

```
